Sometime last year I had stopped reading the news and other publications about the national politics and quit a good chuck of social media to keep my sanity intact for a little longer. I still read some curated content once in a while to be up to date with what’s happening around. Then recently I came across the news that [an Italian artist sold an invisible sculpture titled ‘I am’ for $18,000.](https://nerdist.com/article/invisible-sculpture-salvatore-garau-sold-18000-dollars/) What a neat way to make money. Maybe he’s just selling the idea that anything is art. Even the idea of nothing. The set of all sets includes the null set. The absence of something has to be a thing, just as the presence of something else. And without the idea of nothing, will the idea of something be well defined? The artist would probably say no. Either that, or the buyer probably just bought the world’s most expensive paper.

PS: An interesting video by Vox on [Why are some completely white paintings in the museum.](https://youtu.be/9aGRHOpMRUg)
