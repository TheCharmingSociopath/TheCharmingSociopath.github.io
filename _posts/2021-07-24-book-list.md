This is for me to list out books and essays I've been reading, as well as short takeaways from them. I'm gonna also try to digitise some of the existing notes I have. This is mostly to organise my reading habits, and takeaways in one palce as right now everything is scattered here and there. This might also give me an incentive to read more.
