Last week I finished the eighth and final semester of my undergrad, from my room at home 1260km from college over a shitty internet connection. No JC, DLF, Tawa Bonda, C8 — these are terms my IIIT peers would be familiar with — I celebrated with a good night's sleep. I still have another year at IIIT to finish my masters , and to some institutions I'm still an undergrad. But I am done with my engineering. I guess I'm an engineer now. But don't ask me to fix your phone — I'll probably just delete your WhatsApp and Facebook and hope that does the job. 

I took the week to relax, watch Invincible, play DnD and start reading again — *The Plague, by Albert Camus*. Now that I have some time, I decided to finally start writing this blog. This is something that I've been wanting to do for a long time, but kept procrastinating on. 

Rather than a pedagogical discourse, this is more of an effort to organize my thoughts and resources and to connect with people who might be interested in similar subjects — feel free to hit me up! I have been whimsically writing since I was in school, for the school and college magazine, or for myself, journaling on and off in my diary, writing stories, poems, etc. At one point in life I even considered writing as a career path. But Computer Science and Theoretical Physics charmed me away. 

I do prefer a pen and a paper to typing. It's less distracting, thoughts seem to flow more easily, and it's a lot more privacy friendly. But I'm inclined to give in to this tradition for a while and see where it takes me. It’s definitely better than posting on social media, where I might have to switch through 10 different platforms over the years, trying to keep up with the latest trends while losing the content and  paying with data all along the way. 

I'll try to write fairly regularly from now on, mostly about what I work on or read — and as a bonus I might also dump random facts or resources I discover every now and then. What you might expect to find here: Quantum Computing, Complexity Theory, Theoretical Physics, life updates, book recommendations and reviews, and more. So keep checking back in to see what's up! Or better yet, add the RSS link to your preferred aggregator— I use and love [Feedly](https://www.feedly.com/).
