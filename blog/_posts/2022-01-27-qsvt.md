In this section we present a self contained overview of the technique of Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) presented in [GSLW2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01838), generalizing Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). We refer the reader to an excellent paper [Grand Unification of Quantum Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02859) for a more complete overview of these techniques. QSP is a quantum algorithm to apply a $$d$$-degree bounded polynomial transformation with parity $$d \mod 2$$ to an arbitrary quantum subsystem, using a quantum circuit $$U_{\Phi}$$ consisting of only controlled single qubit rotations. This is achieved by interleaving what is called a *signal rotation operator* $$W$$, which is an $$x$$-rotation by some fixed angle $$\theta$$ and a *signal processing operator* $$S_{\phi}$$, which is an $$z$$-rotation by a variable angle parameterized by some $$\phi \in [0, 2 \pi]$$. Note that the choice of $$x$$ and $$z$$ axes is conventional, and other equivalent constructions exist. Conventionally, the signal rotation operator is defined as

$$
    W(x) := \begin{pmatrix}
        x & i \sqrt{1 - x^2} \\
        i \sqrt{1 - x^2} & x
    \end{pmatrix},
$$

which is an $$x$$-rotation by an angle $$\theta = -2 \arccos(x)$$, and the signal processing operator is defined as

$$
    S_{\phi} := e^{i \phi Z},
$$

which is a $$z$$-rotation by an angle $$- 2 \phi$$. Fascinatingly, sandwiching them together for some $$\Phi := ( \phi_0, \phi_1, \ldots \phi_d ) \in \mathbb{R}^{d + 1}$$, as shown above, gives us a matrix whose elements are polynomial transformations of $$x$$,

$$
    U_{\Phi} := e^{i \phi_0 Z} \prod_{j = 1}^{j= d} \left(  W(x) e^{ i \phi_j Z } \right) \\
             = \begin{pmatrix}
        P(x) & i Q(x) \sqrt{1 - x^2} \\
        i Q^*(x) \sqrt{1 - x^2} & P^*(x)
    \end{pmatrix},
$$

such that
- $$\deg P \leq d;\ \deg Q \leq d - 1 $$,
- $P(x) $ has a parity $d \mod 2 $,
- $$\| P(x) \|^2 + (1 - x^2) \| Q(x) \|^2 = 1 \quad \forall x \in [-1, 1]$$.

Following the application of the quantum circuit $ U_{\Phi} $ for an appropriate $$\Phi$$, one can project into the top left block of $$U_{\Phi}$$ to recover the polynomial $$\bra{0} U_{\Phi} \ket{0} = P(x)$$. Projecting to other basis allows the ability to perform more interesting polynomial transformations, which can be linear combinations of $$ P(x), Q(x) $$, and their complex conjugates. For example, projecting to $$\{ \ket{+}, \ket{-} \}$$ basis gives us


$$
    \bra{+} U_{\Phi} \ket{+} = \real (P(x)) + i \real (Q(x)) \sqrt{1 - x^2} .
$$

This procedure can be naturally generalized to apply a similar polynomial transformation to each singular value of an arbitrary block of a unitary matrix. Suppose we have access to a matrix $ A $ which is block encoded into some unitary $ U_A $, and can be accessed by projectors $ \Pi, \widetilde{\Pi} $ as $ A := \widetilde{\Pi} U_A \Pi $. The singular value decomposition of $ A $ is given as

$$
    A := W \Sigma V^{\dagger} = \sum_j \sigma_j \ket{w_j} \bra{w_j},
$$

where $ W, V $ are unitary matrices, $ \Sigma $ is a diagonal matrix whose $j^{th}$ diagonal entry is $ \sigma_j $, the singular value of $ A $, and $ \ket{w_j}, \ket{v_j} $ are the corresponding singular vectors (the columns of $W$ and $V$ respectively.)
Then one can interleave $ U_A $ and $ U_A^{\dagger} $ with a \emph{projector controlled phase shift} operator, $ \Pi_{\phi} := e^{i \phi ( 2 \Pi - I )}, \widetilde{\Pi}_{\phi} := e^{i \phi ( 2 \widetilde{\Pi} - I )} $, for a parameter $ \phi $. For a given phase angle sequence $ \Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{d} $, the QSVT sequence is given as


$$
    U_{\Phi} = \begin{cases}
        \widetilde{\Pi}_{\phi_1} U_A \left[ \prod_{k = 1}^{(d - 1) / 2} \Pi_{\phi_{2k}} U_A^{\dagger} \widetilde{\Pi}_{\phi_{2 k + 1}} U_A \right] & d \text{ is odd } \\
        \left[ \prod_{k = 1}^{d/ 2} \Pi_{\phi_{2k - 1}} U_A^{\dagger} \widetilde{\Pi}_{\phi_{2 k}} U_A \right] & d \text{ is even},
    \end{cases}
$$


where $ \phi_i $ is the $i^{th}$ element of $ \Phi $. Now projecting to $ \Pi, \widetilde{\Pi} $ gives us the polynomial transformation of $ A $ as


$$
    P^{SV} (A) = \begin{cases}
        \widetilde{\Pi} U_{\Phi} \Pi & d \text{ is odd} \\
        \Pi U_{\Phi} \Pi & d \text{ is even},
    \end{cases}
$$

where $ P^{SV} (A) $ is the polynomial transformation of the matrix $ A $ defined as


$$
    P^{SV} (A) := \begin{cases}
        \sum_j P(\sigma_j) \ket{w_j} \bra{v_j} & P \text{ is odd} \\
        \sum_j P(\sigma_j) \ket{v_j} \bra{v_j} & P \text{ is even},
    \end{cases}
$$

This gives us an extremely powerful primitive to design novel quantum algorithms. In this work we use QSVT for matrix inversion and square root decomposition of a matrix. In the remainder of this section, we shall formally lay out the theorems for these transformations.
