- title: Quantum vs. classical complexity of learning total functions from oracles, and formalising learnability.
  date: Friday, 21 March 2025, 2:00 PM
  where: Divesh's Group Seminars
  location: "COM1-03-19 - Meeting Rm 1 @ COM1"
  abstract: >
    Suppose I give you an arbitrary oracle that encodes a total Boolean function $f$. How many queries would you need to learn the complete truth table of $f$? What about when I give you coherent access to the oracle as well, and you have a large enough quantum computer? We'll start with these questions, and try to learn how learning works, in the exact and PAC models.
    This talk is roughly based on three papers: https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9805006 (FOCS'98), https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0018 (IPL 2010) and https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0007036 (CCC2001). However, we will probably only see the first one with the gory details.

- title: Lower bounds for lattice sieving via approximate nearest neighbour search.
  date: 02 Feb, 2024, 12 noon.
  where: Divesh's Group Seminars

    The shortest (non-zero) vector problem (SVP) on a lattice forms the basis for a majority of the proposed post quantum cryptosystems. Lattice sieving is currently the best known algorithm to solve SVP. Given the importance of the problem, it has received significant attention in the past two decades, leading to several (largely heuristic) improvements over the initial ASK Sieve (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/380752.380857). Most improvements rely on locality sensitive hashing to speed up the approximate nearest neighbour search (which forms the core subroutine of lattice sieving.) In this talk, we present lower bounds for lattice sieving (Laarhoven, Crypto 2021), and for the approximate nearest neighbour search problem (Rubinstein, STOC 2018). We highlight the possibility of a stronger lower bound on lattice sieving via Rubinstein'18.

- title: Lattice sieving via quantum random walks.

    Building upon the contents of the talk in the previous week, we will first describe a framework for lattice sieving which can then be extended into novel classical and quantum algorithms for the shortest vector problems. We will mainly focus on the quantum algorithm using random walks on a Johnson graph, which achieves a SoTA asymptotic complexity.

    The asymptotic complexity of SVP and related problems is important to determine the NIST security standards for various lattice based encryption schemes. Today we will discuss how nearest neighbour search via random product codes and hashing can be used to create new algorithms for SVP.
