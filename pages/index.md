Currently I'm a research assistant at [Centre for Quantum Technologies (CQT)](https://quantumlah.org), National University of Singapore (NUS).
Before this I did a joint bachelors and masters in CS from IIIT Hyderabad, affiliated with [CSTAR, IIIT Hyderabad](http://cstar.iiit.ac.in) and [CQST, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cqst.iiit.ac.in/) where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shantanav Chakraborty](https://sites.google.com/view/shchakra) and Prof [Indranil Chakrabarty](https://sites.google.com/view/indranilchakrabarty/).

### Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in theoretical computer science (especially algorithms and complexity theory) and numerical analysis.
You can find my publications [here](/publications).

### About Me

I love to lift weights, jog and practice Martial Arts.
In my free time I like to read and watch Sci-Fi. You can find some of the books and papers I like [here](/reading/).
I love to code and read about large software systems. You can find some of the projects I've worked on [here](/projects/).
I'm probably a chaotic good druid <i class="fa fa-hand-peace"></i> although I occasionally identify as a bard xD.
Feel free to reach out to me about stuff you think I'll like, or talk about whatever.
