I'm a PhD student at [Centre for Quantum Technologies (CQT)](https://quantumlah.org), National University of Singapore (NUS).
I'm honoured to be advised by [Prof. Divesh Aggarwal](https://sites.google.com/site/diveshhomepage/).

I did a joint bachelors and masters in CS from IIIT Hyderabad, affiliated with [CSTAR, IIIT Hyderabad](http://cstar.iiit.ac.in) and [CQST, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cqst.iiit.ac.in/) where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shantanav Chakraborty](https://sites.google.com/view/shchakra) and Prof [Indranil Chakrabarty](https://sites.google.com/view/indranilchakrabarty/). Here I was working on [Quantum Algorithms](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-04-27-988/). 

<span style="color:red">NEWS: </span> New preprint [On the practicality of quantum sieving algorithms for the shortest vector problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13759) is up on arxiv. 

### Research Interests

My research interests span theoretical computer science, but I particularly like algorithms (approximation and quantum algorithms, applied to optimization, natural sciences, and numerical analysis), and complexity theory (hardness, non-approximability and its connections to cryptography and physics).
You can find my publications [here](/publications).

Another side of me loves to program large software systems with heavy low-level optimisations, particularly in C++. I got particularly interested in this after by brief stint at Goldman Sachs working on a highly performant distributed database system (SecDB).

My CV (Updated Aug 2024) **[PDF](../assets/documents/cv.pdf)** 

### About Me

I love to lift weights, jog and practice Martial Arts.
In my free time I like to read and watch Sci-Fi. You can find some of the books and papers I like [here](/reading/).
I love to code and read about large software systems. You can find some of the projects I've worked on [here](/projects/).
I'm probably a chaotic good druid <i class="fa fa-hand-peace"></i> although I occasionally identify as a bard.
Feel free to reach out to me about stuff you think I'll like, or talk about whatever.
