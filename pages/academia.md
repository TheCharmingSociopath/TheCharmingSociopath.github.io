- My MS thesis can be found [here](../assets/documents/thesis.pdf)
- I took up an independent study under Prof. Shantanav Chakraborty on Adiabatic Quantum Computing and Optimization. Here is the [report](../assets/documents/Adiabatic Quantum Computing and Optimization.pdf) I wrote for the same. It contains a bunch of paper reviews and some random readings.
- I credited a course called Open Quantum Systems and Quantum Thermodynamics in monsoon 2020. As a part of the project, I was given a master equation for a Qubit system, and was supposed to analyse it. Here is [my work](../assets/documents/Open_Quantum_Systems_Project.pdf).
- Long long ago, when I had started learning quantum computing and information theory, I wrote some notes. Might be helpful to beginners. This contains theoretical introduction to QC, and some basic Qiskit I learned back then (which is pretty much useless by now I assume), along with some random notes and research paper summaries.

- I credited a course on complexity theory in monsoon 2020. For the course project, we were to form a team of 3 people, and each member of the team was supposed to either record a lecture, prepare notes or prepare a quiz and assignment on a topic not taught in class (pretty neat idea :P). We picked "PCPs and hardness of approximation," as I found the topic to be really interesting. My part was to record a lecture on the topic. I mostly referred to chaper 18 of the book "Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach" by Arora and Barak and a lecture by Ryan O'Donnell for TCS toolkit course at CMU. [Here is the YouTube link to the recording.](https://youtu.be/zFyy2H_7oOk) I'd probably reorganise the sections a bit if I had to do it again. Also try not to record each topic separately :P <br/>
PS: TCS Toolkit (CMU) has the coolest syllabus I've seen for a course yet. Highly recommended for anyone into theoretical CS.
- I wrote a report on "[Modelling the stock market using game theory](../assets/documents/Modelling%20the%20stock%20market%20using%20game%20theory.pdf)" for the Introduction to Game Theory UG course.
