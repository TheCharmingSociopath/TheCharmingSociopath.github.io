This is a space for all the things I love or find interesting. And a bunch of notes I took during studies. Stuff here might be helpful for someone getting started with Quantum computing, complexity theory or some other stuff that I've already been through. 

### Quantum Computing
- This began as a honours project report, but then I kept jotting down stuff. Maybe helpful for beginners. This contains theoretical introduction to QC, and some basic Qiskit I learned back then, along with some random notes and research paper summaries.
[My notes on Quantum Computing](../assets/documents/Quantum_Notes.pdf)
- I credited a course called Open Quantum Systems and Quantum Thermodynamics in monsoon 2020. As a part of the project, I was given a master equation for a Qubit system, and was supposed to analyse it. Here is [my work](../assets/documents/Open_Quantum_Systems_Project.pdf). 

### Complexity Theory
- I credited a course on complexity theory in monsoon 2020. For the course project, we were to form a team of 3 people, and each member of the team was supposed to either record a lecture, prepare notes or prepare a quiz and assignment on a topic not taught in class (pretty neat idea :P). We picked "PCPs and hardness of approximation," as I found the topic to be really interesting. My part was to record a lecture on the topic. I mostly referred to chaper 18 of the book "Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach" by Arora and Barak and a lecture by Ryan O'Donnell for TCS toolkit course at CMU. [Here is the YouTube link to the recording.](https://youtu.be/zFyy2H_7oOk) I'd probably reorganise the sections a bit if I had to do it again. Also try not to record each topic separately :P
PS: TCS Toolkit (CMU) has the coolest syllabus I've seen for a course yet. Highly recommended for anyone into theoretical CS. 

### Game Theory
- I wrote a report on "[Modelling the stock market using game theory](../assets/documents/Modelling%20the%20stock%20market%20using%20game%20theory.pdf)" for my Game Theory UG course.
