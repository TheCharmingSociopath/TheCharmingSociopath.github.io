I'm Aditya Morolia, a computer science undergrad student at [CQST, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cqst.iiit.ac.in/) advised by Prof. [Shantanav Chakraborty](https://sites.google.com/view/shchakra) and Prof [Indranil Chakrabarty](https://sites.google.com/view/indranilchakrabarty/). 

### Research Interests

I'm broadly interested in theoretical computer science (especially complexity theory, quantum algorithms) and numerical analysis. 
In the past I've worked on Variable-Time Quantum Algorithms for Regularized Linear Regression using Quantum Singular Value Transformation. 
Next, I would like to explore how these techniques can be used to solve other linear algebra problems, in simulating systems in physics and chemistry, and in optimization and machine learning. 
I also explored scientific computing and reinforcement learning through projects on graph NNs and freelance projects. I would love to learn and work on these in the future. 
You can find my publications [here](/publications). 
You can find some other stuff written by me [here](/academia/). 

**New!** I recently put up a preprint of my first paper [Quantum Regularized Least Squares](https://scirate.com/arxiv/2206.13143).

### About Me

In my free time I like to read and watch Sci-Fi and Fantasy. I also read about political science and economics frequently. You can find some of the books I've read [here](/reading/).
I love to work out, run and practice Martial Arts.
I love to code and read about large software systems. You can find some of the projects I've worked on [here](/projects/).
I'm a chaotic good druid forver <i class="fa fa-hand-peace"></i>. Occasionally can pose as a bard too xD.
I read that writing helps collect one's thoughts and remember things for longer. I sometimes write about random stuff [here](/blog/).
Feel free to reach out to me about stuff you think I'll like, or talk about whatever.
