### I read and I know things. YouTube really helps. <br/>

Hi, I'm a CS Undergrad student at IIIT Hyderabad, working as a Research Assistant on Quantum Computing. <br/>
I <i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Code, Math and Physics. <br/>
In my free time I like to read and watch Sci-Fi and Fantasy. I also work out, run and practice Martial Arts. <i class="fa fa-hand-peace"></i> <br/>
I'm always looking for projects at the intersection of them all. In an ideal world, I'd do all of the above while travelling around the world.<br/>
Do HMU with stuff you think I'll like. TYIA :3 <br/>
