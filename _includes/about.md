### I read and I know things. But YouTube helps. <br/>

Hi, I'm a CS Undergrad student at IIIT Hyderabad, working as a researcher on Quantum Computing. <br/>
<i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Code, Math and Physics, in that order. <br/>
In my free time I like to read and watch Sci-Fi and Fantasy. Always looking for projects at the intersection of them all. In an ideal world, I'd do all of the above while travelling around. <br/>
