### I read and I know things. But YouTube helps. <br/>

Hi, I'm a CS Undergrad student at IIIT Hyderabad, working as a researcher on Quantum Computing. <br/> 
I <i class="fas fa-heart"></i> code, physics and math. <br/> 
Currently trying to learn complexity theory, especially in the context of quantum computing and gravity. Let's see if I have what it takes! <br/> 
In an ideal world, I'd just travel, read and do math. <br/>
