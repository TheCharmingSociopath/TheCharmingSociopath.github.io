### I read and I know things. But YouTube helps. <br/>

Hi, I'm a CS Undergrad student at IIIT Hyderabad, working as a researcher on Quantum Computing. <br/>
I <i class="fas fa-heart"></i> to Code, and study Math and Physics. <br/>
Currently trying to learn complexity theory, especially in the context of quantum computing. I would love research opportunities in this area, as well as Numerical Analysis and ML. <br/>
In my free time I like to read and watch Sci-Fi. In an ideal world, I'd do all of the above while travelling around. <br/>
